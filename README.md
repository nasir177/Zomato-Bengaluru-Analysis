🔑 Key Business Insights
After a thorough analysis of over 6,500 restaurants, the following key insights were uncovered:

Market Saturation vs. Opportunity

Finding: Hosur Road and Koramangala are highly saturated with restaurants, while areas such as Kengeri and Peenya remain significantly underserved.

Actionable Insight: This presents a clear opportunity for Zomato's sales team to focus expansion efforts and onboard new restaurant partners in untapped markets.

Consumer Preference for Fast-Service

Finding: "Quick Bites" and "Casual Dining" formats dominate, making up more than 55% of all restaurants in the city.

Actionable Insight: This confirms a strong market demand for affordable and fast-service options, which can guide targeted marketing campaigns and promotions.

Critical Role of Digital Adoption

Finding: Around 67% of restaurants support online ordering, while less than 14% offer table booking.

Actionable Insight: Online ordering is a critical feature for success. The low adoption of table booking suggests a potential opportunity to educate restaurant partners on its benefits to increase revenue.
